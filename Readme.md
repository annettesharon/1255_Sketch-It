Summary :
	Sketch it as the name suggests is a drawing app which provides an environment for innovative minds to work together. This is an android application which will be fun to use. This was created as an event for our symposium. It requires two players to draw a single picture (for eg : a lion) . It is upto the players to plan how to draw (for eg : if one draws the head of the lion, then the other player must draw the body) because what they both draw will be merged and displayed on the screen to everyone.

Installation Procedure : 
Step 1 : Copy the AshUDPClient.apk file to atleast two                tablets.
Step 2 : Run the sketch server.exe in one computer system.
Step 3 : Note the ip address on the system.
Step 4 : Run the AshUDPClient.apk file in the tablet and in               the settings set the ip and give the team name as team              A in both the tablets.
Step 5 : In the server, the team A  is connected message will be              seen.
Step 6 : Click the Show/Hide viewer display button, a screen              will appear.

Usage : 
	Now, draw a picture using both the tablets and see which team draws the best.
